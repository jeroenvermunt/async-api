# pysdk - Universal SDK for Async API Connections

pysdk is a powerful Python package that provides a universal software development kit (SDK) for connecting to various APIs in an asynchronous manner. It aims to simplify the process of interacting with APIs by offering a consistent interface and handling common tasks such as authentication, rate limiting, and error handling.

## Current features

- **Async Support**: pysdk is built using async/await syntax, allowing you to write efficient and non-blocking code when working with APIs.
- **Universal Interface**: The package provides a unified interface for connecting to different APIs, reducing the learning curve when switching between services.

## Future/ optional features

- **Authentication Handling**: pysdk supports multiple authentication mechanisms, including API keys, OAuth, and JWT tokens, making it easy to connect to secure APIs.
- **Rate Limiting**: The SDK includes rate limiting capabilities, helping you stay within the API's rate limits and avoid potential disruptions.
- **Error Handling**: pysdk provides robust error handling mechanisms, allowing you to handle and log API errors gracefully.

## Installation

You can install pysdk using pip:
